## Quick Start

### Lean 4 Proof Verification
```bash
lake build
lake exe UniformHittingTime
```

### Python Analysis
```bash
uv sync
uv run python test_all.py
```

## Main Theorem

The core mathematical result is formalized in Lean 4:

```lean
theorem uniform_sum_hitting_time_expectation : 
  expected_hitting_time = exp 1
```

This establishes that the expected hitting time for uniform random sums equals Euler's number e.

## Mathematical Foundation

The proof uses the telescoping property:
- P(τ = n) = (n-1)/n! for n ≥ 2
- E[τ] = ∑_{n=2}^∞ n·P(τ=n) = ∑_{n=2}^∞ 1/(n-1)! = e

## Mathematical Background

This problem is a classic example of hitting time analysis with these key properties:

1. **Irwin-Hall Distribution**: Distribution of S_n = sum of n uniform [0,1) variables
2. **Core Formula**: P(S_n < 1) = 1/n!
3. **Expected Value**: E[τ] = ∑_{n=0}^∞ P(τ > n) = ∑_{n=0}^∞ 1/n! = e
4. **Telescoping Series**: The beautiful mathematical structure leading to Euler's number
